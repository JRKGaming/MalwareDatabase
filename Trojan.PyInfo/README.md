A simple trojan project I am working on. I was triggered by Wacatac trojan because it stole my information. So I decided why not make one myself? : )

This project started on 3/09/2021. The day when I discovered that a file stored all of my information. Which led to my discord account hacking.
It's written in Python 3.9.6

Installation (Do I need to explain??):-
Open command prompt and type...
1) pip install pyinstaller
2) pyinstaller file.pyw --onefile
